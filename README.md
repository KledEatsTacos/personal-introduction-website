# Personal Introduction Website

This is a project for my web technologies class.
In this project, I created a website to introduce myself and my country (the country where I was born and raised).

## Features
- Personal introduction page.
- Information about my country.
- Responsive design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Basic server-side functionality with PHP.

Professor, if you ever happen to read this, I hated every single minute of this. Thank you.
